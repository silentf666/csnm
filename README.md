# Crazy Simple Network Monitoring (CSNM)
Crazy simple network monitoring tool.
I didnt really found any simple network monitoring tool so i wrote one with python myself. Im not a programer and my python is a bit rusty but it seem to run nice and smooth so far.
Its running on my Raspberry pi 4 and hardly needs any resources (that was the goal)
Its not ment for productive business monitoring but rather for home lab enverionment.
